# Nexus Website UI/UX Redesign and Front-end Integration

## Project Overview

This repository contains the front-end code and design assets for the Nexus website redesign project. The primary goal is to enhance the overall **visual aesthetic** and **ergonomics** of the site, ensuring a fluid, responsive, and high-performance user experience.

The project requires a skilled **Front-end UI/UX Developer** to finalize the design mockups in Figma and fully integrate the required web pages.

### Key Objectives

1.  **UI/UX Design Finalization:** Complete and refine mockups for new pages, maintaining strict adherence to UI/UX best practices and the existing graphic charter.
2.  **Front-end Integration:** Transform all approved mockups into a fully functional and responsive website using modern web technologies (HTML5, CSS3).
3.  **Performance Optimization:** Implement techniques to reduce load times, optimize media, and ensure uninterrupted, high-speed navigation.

## Features & Scope

The project focuses on the design and integration of the following pages/elements:

| Page/Feature | Description | User Story Goal |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

| **"BLOG"** | Integration of the blog page structure. | Ensure clarity of descriptions and visual impact, using light animations. |
| **"CONTACT"** | Implementation of a dedicated contact page. | Include an interactive and accessible form for easy request submission. |
| **"Tournament"** | Conversion of the existing mockup into functional code. | Code must be functional and compatible with different browsers. |
| **Responsive Design**| Ensuring all pages display optimally across mobile, tablet, and desktop devices. | Excellent readability on all screens using Media Queries. |
| **Bonus: "Event" Page**| Integration of a dedicated "Event & Join Tournament" page. | Follow best security and ergonomics practices. |
